Tutorial App Access Control System
===

This tutorial has three goals:
- learn how to make a simple user interface in Flutter
- build the code base of the client app that you have to do in the third milestone of the practicum
- make the starting point for a flutter exercise

Code base means that some parts of the code you'll probably want to keep them, but others related to the user interface appearance, will definitely be changed.

This is what we are going to build:

![](sequence.gif)
<br>

What this animation shows is :
- two types of screens, one for partitions and spaces, another for the doors giving access to a space
- navigation down and up the hierarchy of partitions, spaces and doors of the building in the simulator
- send refresh, area and door requests to the server, and udpdate the data presented in the interface

Preconditions:
- you have installed Flutter into IntelliJ. If not, see how to in the practicum handout. Or see section [Environment](#environment) below.
- you have read the slides on Dart and Flutter, including Flutter "futures"
- optionally you have also gone through the getting started codelab in [flutter.dev](http://flutter.dev)

<br>


# 1. Environment <a id="environment"></a>

Installing Flutter plus everything needed to develop for Android (the Android virtual devices, the Android SDK, set up your mobile phone in order to run the app in it or the Android emulator etc.) takes time. You will eventually do it in the third milestone but now there are two shortcuts to do this tutorial and to start the exercise right away. 
<br>

1. Simplest, no installation required whatsoever : go to <a href="https://dartpad.dev">https://dartpad.dev</a>, make a new pad of Flutter type, copy-paste the code below to the "pad" and click button Run whenever you want to execute it. The only difference is that all the code goes to the same "file", not to different files like in IntelliJ, and consequently you need to not repeat and move to the top the imports.
<br>
<br>

2. Use IntelliJ but defer execution on your mobile or the emulator and instead set as application target your Linux or Windows desktop. Select File $\rightarrow$ New  $\rightarrow$ Project  $\rightarrow$ Flutter and configuration
<br>

# 2. First two screens

First step is to create Dart classes to represent partitions, spaces and doors. These classes won't have methods but just hold data to be displayed in the user interface. Hence, we won't be able to order any action yet.

In a mobile screen it is infeasible to show the whole hierarchy, so we will show at each moment the children of a certain node: the child partitions and spaces of a father partition, or the doors of a space. The name of the father node will be displayed as the title of the screen.

Since the data to show is different for areas and doors, there will be two different screens, views in Flutter terms, one for each type. 

For the moment we will instantiate a fixed tree in Dart, that of the simulator building. In this way we defer the connection to the ACU webserver to a later stage and start simple. Later on, we will discard this tree and the data shown will be the answer to a REST query to the ACU webserver, a ``get_children`` request.


## 2.1 Create the data to show

Launch IntelliJ and create a new Flutter project named `tutorial_acs`. Let the wizard create the `lib/main.dart` file for you. Add a new Dart file to the lib folder named `tree.dart` with the following content:


```dart
abstract class Area{
  late String id;
  late List<dynamic> children;
  Area(this.id, this.children);
}

class Partition extends Area {
  Partition(String id, List<Area>children) : super(id, children);
}

class Space extends Area {
  Space(String id, List<Door> children) : super(id, children);
}

class Door {
  late String id;
  late bool closed;
  late String state;
  Door({required this.id, this.state="unlocked", this.closed=true});
}

// at the moment this class seems unnecessary but later we will extend it
class Tree {
  late Area root;

  Tree(this.root);
}

Tree getTree(String id) {
  final List<Door> doors = List<Door>.of([
    Door(id:"D1"), Door(id:"D2"), Door(id:"D3"), Door(id:"D4"), Door(id:"D5"),
    Door(id:"D6"), Door(id:"D7"), Door(id:"D8"), Door(id:"D9")
  ]);

  Map<String, Area> areas = {};
  areas["parking"] = Space("parking", List<Door>.of([doors[0], doors[1]]));
  areas["room1"] = Space("room1", List<Door>.of([doors[4]]));
  areas["room2"] = Space("room2", List<Door>.of([doors[5]]));
  areas["hall"] = Space("hall", List<Door>.of([doors[2], doors[3]]));
  areas["room3"] = Space("room3", List<Door>.of([doors[7]]));
  areas["it"] = Space("it", List<Door>.of([doors[8]]));
  areas["corridor"] = Space("corridor", List<Door>.of([doors[6]]));
  areas["basement"] = Partition("basement", List<Area>.of([areas["parking"]!]));
  areas["ground_floor"] = Partition("ground_floor",
      List<Area>.of([areas["room1"]!, areas["room2"]!, areas["hall"]!
      ]));
  areas["floor1"] = Partition("floor1",
      List<Area>.of([areas["room3"]!, areas["it"]!, areas["corridor"]!
      ]));
  areas["building"] = Partition("building",
      List<Area>.of([areas["basement"]!, areas["ground_floor"]!, areas["floor1"]!
      ]));

  return Tree(areas[id]!);
}

testGetTree() {
  Tree tree;

  for (String id in ["building", "hall", "floor1", "room1"]) {
    tree = getTree(id);
    if (tree.root is Partition) {
      print("root ${tree.root.id}");
      for (Area area in tree.root.children) {
        print("child ${area.id}");
      }
    } else {
      print("root ${tree.root.id}");
      for (Door door in tree.root.children) {
        print("child ${door.id}, state ${door.state}, closed ${door.closed}");
      }
    }
    print("");
  }
}

void main() {
  testGetTree();
}
```

Read the code, it's simple: two classes ``Partition`` and ``Space`` inherit from ``Area``. In function ``getTree()`` we instantiate a dictionary whose keys are area ids and the value the subtree that has that area as root node.

Declaring an attribute as ``late`` means we are not giving it a value right now, but it will be assigned a non-null value in the constructor. The ``!`` means we are going to check during execution that the value of a variable or expression is not null, and if it is, launch an exception.

To run this test in IntelliJ, run Current file, or make a new run configuration. In https://dartpad.dev simply copy-paste the code to a new Flutter pad and click on the Run button. You'll see the following output

```text
root building
child basement
child ground_floor
child floor1

root hall
child D3, state unlocked, closed true
child D4, state unlocked, closed true

root floor1
child room3
child it
child corridor

root room1
child D5, state unlocked, closed true
```

<br>

## 2.2 Create a screen to show areas

**1.** In IntelliJ, open file `main.dart` and replace its content by this.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(const MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({super.key});

  // This widget is the root of your application.
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'ACS',
      theme: ThemeData(
        colorScheme: ColorScheme.fromSeed(seedColor: Colors.deepPurple),
        useMaterial3: true,
        textTheme: const TextTheme(
          bodyMedium: TextStyle(fontSize: 20), // size of hello
        ),
        // see https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/design/themes
      ),
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: const Text('Access Control System'),
        ),
        body: const Center(
          child: Text('Hello'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

```

<img src="hello.png" style="border: 2px solid black;">

<br>

Now we are going to make the screen that shows the children partitions and spaces of a partition, that is the root of a ``Tree`` object.

**2.** Create a new Dart file in `lib` folder named `screen_partition.dart`. The file is empty.

**3.** Write ``stful`` and upon pressing Return this code will appear

```dart
class  extends StatefulWidget {
  const ({super.key});

  @override
  State<> createState() => _State();
}

class _State extends State<> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return const Placeholder();
  }
}
```

**4.** This is a template we have to complete by specifying some class names: ``ScreenPartition`` and ``_ScreenPartitionState``. Also, there are some errors because we still have to import the library ``material`` defining the classes Widget, State etc.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class ScreenPartition extends StatefulWidget {
  const ScreenPartition({super.key});

  @override
  State<ScreenPartition> createState() => _ScreenPartitionState();
}

class _ScreenPartitionState extends State<ScreenPartition> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return const Placeholder();
  }
}
```

**5.** Class ``_ScreenPartitionState`` is in charge of getting the data to show, which is the state. When partition page is first drawn, or when the ``setState()`` is invoked, the page will automatically be redrawn with the data in the state object. For now let's just get a ``Tree`` object from the ``getTree()`` function in file `tree.dart` :

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:tutorial_acs/tree.dart';

class ScreenPartition extends StatefulWidget {
  const ScreenPartition({super.key});

  @override
  State<ScreenPartition> createState() => _ScreenPartitionState();
}

class _ScreenPartitionState extends State<ScreenPartition> {
  late Tree tree;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    tree = getTree("building");
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return const Placeholder();
  }
}
```

**6.** Now we are going to edit the ``build()`` method so that it draws a list view whose items are the childs of the tree. Replace the stub build method by this:

```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Scaffold(
    appBar: AppBar(
      title: Text(tree.root.id),
      actions: <Widget>[
        IconButton(icon: const Icon(Icons.home),
            onPressed: () {}
          // TODO go home page = root
        ),
        //TODO other actions
      ],
    ),
    body: ListView.separated(
      // it's like ListView.builder() but better
      // because it includes a separator between items
      padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
      itemCount: tree.root.children.length,
      itemBuilder: (BuildContext context, int index) =>
          _buildRow(tree.root.children[index], index),
      separatorBuilder: (BuildContext context, int index) =>
      const Divider(),
    ),
  );
}
```

**7.** Note that the named constructor of ``Listview`` has a parameter ``itemBuilder`` that expects a function returning the widget to show as a certain position (index) of the list. This function is ``_buildRow()``:


```dart
Widget _buildRow(Area area, int index) {
  assert (area is Partition || area is Space);
  if (area is Partition) {
    return ListTile(
      title: Text('P ${area.id}'),
      onTap: () => {},
      // TODO, navigate down to show children areas
    );
  } else {
    return ListTile(
      title: Text('S ${area.id}'),
      onTap: () => {},
      // TODO, navigate down to show children doors
    );
  }
}
```

**8.** Finally in ``main.dart`` replace ``home: Scaffold(...)`` by `` home: const ScreenPartition()``. Last thing: there's a Home button on the top right corner hidden under the debug banner. To remove the banner add this line:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:tutorial_acs/screen_partition.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(const MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({super.key});

  // This widget is the root of your application.
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false,
      // removes the debug banner that hides the home button
      title: 'ACS',
      theme: ThemeData(
        colorScheme: ColorScheme.fromSeed(seedColor: Colors.deepPurple),
        useMaterial3: true,
        textTheme: const TextTheme(
          bodyMedium: TextStyle(fontSize: 20), // size of hello
        ),
        // see https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/design/themes
      ),
      home: const ScreenPartition(),
    );
  }
}

```

**9.** Now run again with hot reload <img src="hotreload.png"> and this is what we get:

<img src="screen_partition.png" style="border: 2px solid black;">

<br>

## 2.3 Creating the screen to show doors

We are going to make another screen to show the doors of a space. This is necessary because the data to show for doors is different from that of spaces and partitions. In a forthcoming step we'll link the two screens, that is, when you tap on a space in a view list you'll see its doors.

**1.** Add a new file ``screen_space.dart`` to the ``lib`` folder and like before write ``stful`` to get the template and insert the proper class names ``ScreenSpace``, ``_StateScreenSpace``

**2.** Add to class ``_StateScreenSpace`` the methods ``initState()``, ``build()`` and ``_buildRow()`` analogous to those of ``_StateScreenPartition``. And also an attribute ``tree`` of type ``Tree``. The only differences are


```dart
@override
void initState() {
  super.initState();
  tree = getTree("parking");
}

  Widget _buildRow(Door door, int index) {
  return ListTile(
    title: Text('D ${door.id}'),
    trailing: Text('${door.state}, closed=${door.closed}'),
  );
}
```


**3.** Just to check it works, in `main.dart` change the ``home`` attribute to 

```dart
home: ScreenSpace(), // ScreenPartition()
```

<img src="screen_space.png" style="border: 2px solid black;">

<br>


## 2.4 Navigation

We are going now to implement the navigation through the hierarchy of areas. This involves three things:

1. When we launch the app, show the children of ``building``. Or better, show a root node that has building as unique child, so we can perform actions (lock, unlock) on the whole hierarchy, as in the simulator.

1. When we click on an item of a list, show its children. We need to distinguish two cases here, depending on the type of area we have clicked on:
   - partition : just get the new children and show them in the same screen of partitions
   - space : now we have to switch to a space partition to show the doors of the selected space

1. When we press the up button ![](up_button.png) we have to go up in the hierarchy and show the children of the "grandfather" node. This last item will be easy to implement: it comes from free of the way we will program the two former items!


**1.** Add a parameter ``String id`` to the constructor of ``ScreenPartition`` and ``ScreenSpace``. The value of the parameter goes to a new attribute with the same name. It will be accessed by the corresponding state object in order to retrieve with ``getTree(id)`` the children of the node with this id, and show them in the ListView. For ``ScreenPartition`` :

```dart
class ScreenPartition extends StatefulWidget {
  final String id;

  const ScreenPartition({super.key, required this.id});

  @override
  State<ScreenPartition> createState() => _ScreenPartitionState();
}
```
And in its state ``_ScreenPartitionState``

```dart
@override
void initState() {
  super.initState();
  tree = getTree(widget.id);
}

Widget _buildRow(Area area, int index) {
  assert (area is Partition || area is Space);
  if (area is Partition) {
    return ListTile(
      title: Text('P ${area.id}'),
      onTap: () => _navigateDownPartition(area.id),
      // TODO, navigate down to show children areas
    );
  } else {
    return ListTile(
      title: Text('S ${area.id}'),
      onTap: () => _navigateDownSpace(area.id),
      // TODO, navigate down to show children doors
    );
  }
}

void _navigateDownPartition(String childId) {
  Navigator.of(context)
      .push(MaterialPageRoute<void>(builder: (context) => ScreenPartition(id: childId,))
  );
}

void _navigateDownSpace(String childId) {
  Navigator.of(context)
      .push(MaterialPageRoute<void>(builder: (context) => ScreenSpace(id: childId,))
  );
}
```

For its part, in ``_ScreenSpaceState`` we have only to change the method ``initState()`` which is the same as in ``_ScreenPartitionState``. In a state, ``widget`` is an inherited attribute that points to the stateful object that has that state object. We could also pass the ``id`` to the constructor of the state, but this seems simpler.


**2.** Edit ``main.dart`` so that the first screen shown is the children of the tree root. A quick and dirty solution is

```dart
home: const ScreenPartition(id: "building"),
// TODO: this is ugly, the code depends on the particular tree
```

## 2.5 Colors

Last thing we will do is to add some color to the two screens we have implemented. Why color? "Color creates meaning and communicates hierarchy, state, and brand", see Material documentation [here](https://m3.material.io/styles/color/the-color-system/key-colors-tones). Basically, an app instantiates a ``MaterialApp`` that has a ``ColorScheme``. This color scheme defines a set of colors labeled as primary, secondary, tertiary, plus onPrimary etc. These colors are shades or tones of a main color like ``Colors.blue`` or ``Colors.deepPurple`` (the default). Depending on the prominence or accent you want to give to an element of the interface (a button, text, text in the app bar, action buttons etc.) you can set its color as one of the color scheme.

In the following sentences we will select a color scheme around blue and "paint" the app bar background, text and the home icon.


In the constructor of ``MaterialApp``, in ``main.dart``

```dart
colorScheme: ColorScheme.fromSeed(
  seedColor: Colors.blue, // instead of deepPurple
  brightness: Brightness.light,), // light or dark
```

In ``ScreenPartition`` and ``ScreenSpace``, in the constructor of ``AppBar``

```dart
appBar: AppBar(
  backgroundColor: Theme.of(context).colorScheme.primary,
  foregroundColor: Theme.of(context).colorScheme.onPrimary,   
  // that is, on top of primary     
```

This produces the screens of the animation at the begining of this tutorial.

# 3. Connexion with the Java webserver : server side

If you have been using Dartpad for point 1-2, now you have to move the Flutter code to either 1) an IntelliJ project, with desktop as target, or 2) your mobile connected to a USB port, or 3) use the Android emulator, because we are going to connect the app client with the Java webserver implementing de ACU. We recommend you option 1, to switch later to 2.

Until now we have been working with a fake, fixed tree of areas and doors. Fake because it lives on the side of the app, and fixed because the user can not perform actions to change it. Now we are going to get real data from the Java webserver through its REST API, that is, by http requests just like the simulator did. 

However, we are not going to implement actions to lock and unlock partitions and spaces and maybe others. It is up to you to design and implement this kind of interactions. We are just going to navigate the "real" hierarchy in the server.

Basically we have to replace the calls to ``getTree(id)`` in Flutter, by sending a request to the server asking for the children of the node with a given id. The webserver answers with a (maybe long) string that, following the JSON format, contains information of the node with the passed id plus its children. If children are doors, information is their id plus state and if closed or not. The string answer arrives to the Flutter app that decodes it, meaning the app transforms it to a Dart Map, a dictionary of keys (id) and values. This dictionary is then converted to a ``Tree`` object like those ``getTree()`` returns now.

We will start with the changes on the server side.


**1.** Add the class ``RequestChildren`` (imports not listed). Its goal is to build a JSON object with the children of the area with a certain id.

```java
public class RequestChildren implements Request {
  private final String areaId;
  private JSONObject jsonTree; // 1 level tree, root and children

  public RequestChildren(String areaId) {
    this.areaId = areaId;
  }

  public String getAreaId() {
    return areaId;
  }

  @Override
  public JSONObject answerToJson() {
    return jsonTree;
  }

  @Override
  public String toString() {
    return "RequestChildren{areaId=" + areaId + "}";
  }

  public void process() {
    Area area = DirectoryAreas.getInstance().findAreaById(areaId);
    jsonTree = area.toJson(1);
  }
}
```

Note an important detail in the last line, the parameter ``1``. It means the desired depth of the tree, a node plus its children and no more descendants. 

**2.** Add methods ``toJson()``

Each recursive call to ``toJson`` decrements the passed depth value, when received depth is zero, the methods ``toJson()`` do nothing :

- in ``Area`` (superclass of ``Partition`` and ``Space``)

  ```java
  public abstract JSONObject toJson(int depth);
  ```

- in ``Partition``

  ```java
  public JSONObject toJson(int depth) {
    // for depth=1 only the root and children, 
    // for recusive = all levels use Integer.MAX_VALUE
    JSONObject json = new JSONObject();
    json.put("class", "partition");
    json.put("id", id);
    JSONArray jsonAreas = new JSONArray();
    if (depth > 0) {
      for (Area a : areas) {
        jsonAreas.put(a.toJson(depth - 1));
      }
      json.put("areas", jsonAreas);
    }
    return json;
  }
  ```

- in ``Space`` :

  ```java
  public JSONObject toJson(int depth) { // depth not used here
    JSONObject json = new JSONObject();
    json.put("class", "space");
    json.put("id", id);
    JSONArray jsonDoors = new JSONArray();
    for (Door d : doorsGivingAccess) {
      jsonDoors.put(d.toJson());
    }
    json.put("access_doors", jsonDoors);
    return json;
  }
  ```

- in ``Door`` (but this was already in the code we gave you)

  ```java
  public JSONObject toJson() {
    JSONObject json = new JSONObject();
    json.put("id", id);
    json.put("state", getStateName());
    json.put("closed", closed);
    return json;
  }
  ```

**3.** In the Flutter app we have resorted to the following trick to get the children of the root node in the tree (step 2 of section 2.4):

```dart
home: const ScreenPartition(id: "building"),
// TODO: this is ugly, the code depends on the particular tree
```

But of course the client app doesn't know the id of the root node. So will add code to method ``findAreaById()`` that returns the root area if the parameter is the string ``"ROOT"``, and replace ``"building"`` by ``"ROOT"`` in the former app code.

```java
public Area findAreaById(String id) {
  if (id.equals("ROOT")) {
    // Special id that means that the wanted area is the root. 
    // This is because the Flutter app client doesn't know the 
    // id of the root, differently from the simulator
    return rootArea;
  } else {
    //...
  }
```

**4.** In the ``Webserver`` class

```java
switch (tokens[0]) {
  :
  :
  case "get_children":
    request = makeRequestChildren(tokens);
    break;
```

```java
private RequestChildren makeRequestChildren(String[] tokens) {
  String areaId = tokens[1];
  return new RequestChildren(areaId);
}
```

<br>

# 4. Connexion with the Java webserver : client side

Now switch to the Flutter project. We have to add code to send http requests to the server and get the corresponding answer. Remember that here we will only deal with the child request to implement navigation, not with area requests with lock and unlock actions.


**Important** : before proceeding, study the [Flutter documentation on networking](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook/networking/update-data) to understand the code below, that makes a wide use of futures, ``async``, ``await`` and ``then``.

**1.** Make a new file ``requests.dart`` with the following content:

```dart
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;
import 'dart:convert' as convert;

import 'tree.dart';

Future<Tree> getTree(String areaId) async {
  const String BASE_URL = "http://localhost:8080";
  Uri uri = Uri.parse("${BASE_URL}/get_children?$areaId");
  final response = await http.get(uri);
  // response is NOT a Future because of await
  if (response.statusCode == 200) {
    // TODO: change prints by logs, use package Logger for instance 
    // which is the most popular, see https://pub.dev/packages/logger
    print("statusCode=$response.statusCode");
    print(response.body);
    // If the server did return a 200 OK response, then parse the JSON.
    Map<String, dynamic> decoded = convert.jsonDecode(response.body);
    return Tree(decoded);
  } else {
    // If the server did not return a 200 OK response, then throw an exception.
    print("statusCode=$response.statusCode");
    throw Exception('failed to get answer to request $uri');
  }
}
```

The ``http`` library makes easy to send http request to a server and receive and parse the answer. Read this [tutorial](https://dart.dev/tutorials/server/fetch-data) in the Dart website.


**2.** Some errors appear because we have not yet installed the imported library ``http``. Open ``pubspec.yaml`` and add the ``http`` library

```yaml
dependencies:
  http: ^1.1.0
```

Go back to `requests.dart` and cick ``Pub get`` to download it.

**3.** Edit ``tree.dat`` to update the class ``Tree``

```dart
class Tree {
  late Area root;

  Tree(Map<String, dynamic> dec) {
    // 1 level tree, root and children only, root is either Partition or Space.
    // If Partition children are Partition or Space, that is, Area. If root
    // is a Space, children are Door.
    // There is a JSON field 'class' that tells the type of Area.
    if (dec['class'] == "partition") {
      List<Area> children = <Area>[]; // is growable
      for (Map<String, dynamic> area in dec['areas']) {
        if (area['class'] == "partition") {
          children.add(Partition(area['id'], <Area>[]));
        } else if (area['class'] == "space") {
          children.add(Space(area['id'], <Door>[]));
        } else {
          assert(false);
        }
      }
      root = Partition(dec['id'], children);
    } else if (dec['class'] == "space") {
      List<Door> children = <Door>[];
      for (Map<String, dynamic> d in dec['access_doors']) {
        children.add(Door(id: d['id'], state: d['state'], closed: d['closed']));
      }
      root = Space(dec['id'], children);
    } else {
      assert(false);
    }
  }
}
```

**4.** Now we are going to update the two screens, starting with ``screen_partition.dart``. Since ``getTree()`` returns a future, we have to adapt the list view to work with futures also. And the method ``initState()`` where it is invoked.

```dart
class _ScreenPartitionState extends State<ScreenPartition> {
  late Future<Tree> futureTree;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    futureTree = getTree(widget.id);
  }
```

The result of ``getTree()`` goes to a new attribute ``futureTree``, and the builder of ``_ScreenPartitionState`` is not an ``Scaffold`` as before but a ``FutureBuilder`` object, whose constructor has as paramteres a future, ``futureTree`` and a builder, an ``Scaffold`` as before. 

```dart
// future with listview
// https://medium.com/nonstopio/flutter-future-builder-with-list-view-builder-d7212314e8c9
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return FutureBuilder<Tree>(
    future: futureTree,
    builder: (context, snapshot) {
      // anonymous function
      if (snapshot.hasData) {
        return Scaffold(
          appBar: AppBar(
            backgroundColor: Theme.of(context).colorScheme.primary,
            foregroundColor: Theme.of(context).colorScheme.onPrimary,
            title: Text(snapshot.data!.root.id),
            actions: <Widget>[
              IconButton(icon: const Icon(Icons.home), onPressed: () {}
                  // TODO go home page = root
                  ),
              //TODO other actions
            ],
          ),
          body: ListView.separated(
            // it's like ListView.builder() but better because it includes a separator between items
            padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
            itemCount: snapshot.data!.root.children.length,
            itemBuilder: (BuildContext context, int i) =>
                _buildRow(snapshot.data!.root.children[i], i),
            separatorBuilder: (BuildContext context, int index) =>
                const Divider(),
          ),
        );
      } else if (snapshot.hasError) {
        return Text("${snapshot.error}");
      }
      // By default, show a progress indicator
      return Container(
          height: MediaQuery.of(context).size.height,
          color: Colors.white,
          child: Center(
            child: CircularProgressIndicator(),
          ));
    },
  );
}
```

This ``FutureBuilder`` has an atribute ``snapshot`` that contains the ``Tree`` eventually returned by ``getTree()`` in its field ``data``. The ``!`` operator checks it is not null. While the app is waiting for a response to the http request, it shows the typical progress indicator ![](circular_progress_petit.jpg)

Methods ``_buildRow()``, ``_navigateDownPartition()`` and ``_navigateDownPartition()`` don't change (for the moment).

**5.** Next we have to update ``screen_space.dart``. The "good news" is that the changes to perform are the same : we will have the same ``initState()``, ``build()`` than in ``screen_partition.dart``. We are not going to deal with code redundancy now because there are chances these methods will change once we add actions or buttons to the list items. If finally they have to be identical you have to factor out the common parts.

>At this point you can run first the Java server, that keeps listening to requests to address ``localhost:8080``, and then run the client app that sends ``get_children`` requests to this address. You'll see the same as in the animation at the beginning of this tutorial, only that now the displayed data come from the webserver and if you open/close a door, or change its state with the simulator, the changes will be reflected in the app. Check it!


# 5. Refinements

## 5.1 Tunneling

The webserver and the client app run in your computer if you have chosen as target the desktop computer or the Android emulator. Or better, you have connected a mobile to its USB port and the app runs there. There's a third possibility that is to unplug the mobile and make the communication happen thorugh internet "for real". 

Since we are not going to install the webserver into a dedicated machine with a fixed web address, what we need is tunneling : have the address of another web server that redirects the requests to our Java webserver, that is, to ``http://localhost:8080``.

``ngrok`` from https://ngrok.com/ is a small and free application for Windows, Linux, MacOS that does this. Each time you run it like

```bash
$ ngrok http 8080
```

it prints a one-time use address like ``http://f51fb19f.ngrok.io`` that you have to assign to the constant ``BASE_URL`` in function ``getTree()``, in ``requests.dart``.

An alternative to ``ngrok`` is https://serveo.net that does the same but does not need to install anything. You can even request a multi-use address.
  

## 5.2 Automatic refresh

If you do it, you'll realize that the changes made with the simulator on the doors don't appear simultaneously in the app. Suppose you are already seeing the screen with the two doors of the parking, and they are both closed. You open one of them with the simulator, but the app still displays it's closed. The reason is that the app received the data on the doors before you opened the door with the simulator, when it had to display the doors of the parking and therefore re-create the state of ``ScreenSpace`` executing its ``initState()``. If you go up and down again, the door information will be updated.

Of course, we would like the changes in the data show now by the app to be updated automatically. This is possible and easy, but adds a few more lines of code : you have to instantiate a ``Timer`` similar to that of the clock in Java and instruct it to periodically execute ``getTree()`` and ``setState( () {} )`` to get data up to date and redraw the interface. You can find an example [here](https://github.com/disseny-de-software/tutorial_timetracker_app/blob/main/tutorial_timetracker_app.md#7-automatic-refresh). For the moment put this improvement in your TODO list.

## 5.3 Redraw versus re-create

When "going up" from screen B to screen A we won't notice but changes in the data shown by A are not updated, we see the same screen as before. The problem is that "going up" does not call ``initState()`` and as a consequence ``getTree()``, so the data shown is the same. But we don't notice it because the partitions screen just display the names of child areas, that have no state or other data associated, for the moment. This could change as you improve the user interface desing, so this improvement is mandatory.

The solution is quick and easy: make a refresh method that invokes ``getTree()`` and ``setState()``, and invoke it when "going up":

```dart
  void _refresh() async {
    futureTree = getTree(widget.id);
    setState(() {});
  }

  void _navigateDownPartition(String childId) {
    //https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49830553/how-to-go-back-and-refresh-the-previous-page-in-flutter?noredirect=1&lq=1
    // but doing _refresh(); without then() after push may also work
    Navigator.of(context)
        .push(MaterialPageRoute<void>(
      builder: (context) => ScreenPartition(id: childId),
    ))
        .then((var value) {
      _refresh();
    });
  }

  void _navigateDownSpace(String childId) {
    Navigator.of(context)
        .push(MaterialPageRoute<void>(
      builder: (context) => ScreenSpace(id: childId),
    ))
        .then((var value) {
      _refresh();
    });
  }
```


# 6. Hints

**Date and time formatters**. Http reader and area requests like this 

```
http://localhost:8080/reader?credential=11343&action=unlock&datetime=2023-09-05T09:30&doorId=D2
```

include the present date and time (it matters for its authorization or not). In order the app can send these kind of requests you have to convert Dart's date and time to a string following this format. The following code may help:

```dart
import 'package:intl/intl.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class Utils {
  static final DateFormat _dateFormatter = DateFormat("yyyy-MM-dd");
  static final DateFormat _timeFormatter = DateFormat("HH:mm");
    
  static String formattedDate(date) {
    return _dateFormatter.format(date);
  }

  static String formattedTime(time) {
    return  _timeFormatter.format(
      DateTime(1, 1, 1, time.hour, time.minute));
  }

  static String formattedDateTime(date, time) {
    return "${formattedDate(date)}T${formattedTime(time)}";
  }
}

void main() {
  DateTime date = DateTime.now();
  TimeOfDay time = TimeOfDay.now();
  print(Utils.formattedDateTime(date, time));
}
```

**Home button**. These sentences are useful to implement the home button:

```dart
  while(Navigator.of(context).canPop()) {
    print("pop");
    Navigator.of(context).pop();
  }
  // this works also
  // Navigator.popUntil(context, ModalRoute.withName('/'));
  // Now add what to show, the top
```
